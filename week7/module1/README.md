Module 1:  
==========================
>Let's build something cool using very the basics of javascript. A game for instance - always to fun play and think about.
It's always easy to code/learn something if we can relate to relate world example. How about building a simple game or rather a script where we write some logic to find the Winner team. Let's call it "Number Game" for a while - until finding the better name!  

**Module goals**
Learn the use case of variable, object, function, condition, naming convention

``` In following simple steps:```
> Step 0: `console`     : First, build dummy game using console only and implement in later steps 

> Step 1: `variable`    : Say 'Hello' to team player using variable

> Step 2: `object`      : Use object to store player information

> Step 3: `function`    : Remove duplicate code using function

> Step 4: `condition`   : Find the winner team

> Step 5: `refactoring` : Remove more duplicate code

## Final Output
